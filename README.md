## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I used https://freshman.tech/css-grid-calculator/ , W3Schools and my notes 
in my notion account which I made based on information on W3Schools.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[A Challenge I encountered was making css grid do what i wanted without drawbacks.
My goal was to make the six buttons stay on a 3*2 array, using the regular css
grid column function made the 3*2 array but the buttons were too far apart 
as each column was set to take 1/3 of the width of the website. At first
I tried to fix this with setting the maximum width of the grid container to fit
just the 3 buttons and the 2 gaps which made the buttons closer together
but when the window was expanded they would shift to the left of the screen 
leaving a massive blank space to the right.I couldn't think of a way to move
the container to start in the middle of the screen so I did some re]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[What is the usual process of bringing up a new feature you want to an app to the team
 and if the feature is complex and needs multiple people to develop in a reasonable time
 how would the proposal of the feature be handled as opposed to a proposal for a simple
 feature you can complete yourself?
  How often are completely new projects developed as opposed to managing an existing project?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I would add pre-set melodies based on know music such as Super Mario Bros 
 with the user being able to select it with a button that changes the pattern and frequency map values to make that melody.
 I would also create key bindings to represent each button in the html file so that the 
 controls of the game would feel better and the user can play the game faster, the keys i would 
 bind the six buttons with are "Q,W,E,A,S,D" respectively.]
